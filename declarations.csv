Cuffe ,https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-03-09-INT-3-177-0000_EN.html,"Madam President, this proposal on batteries is welcome and timely. In the last two weeks, the rulebook on energy has been rewritten. The goals of geopolitics and the climate movement now converge on the need to phase out fossil fuels. As we move towards electrification in all spheres, batteries will play a crucial role in weaning ourselves off fossil fuels, including Russian sources, and this will result in healthier communities with cleaner air.

And with transport, we shouldn’t just promote a private electric vehicle for everyone. The resources required would be enormous, and it wouldn’t solve issues like congestion and road safety. So instead, let’s allocate the required rare earths and minerals smartly, for example, by electrifying public transport as part of our modal shift efforts.

And I strongly welcome the Parliament’s position on the batteries in waste batteries regulation. I welcome the expansionist scope to cover all batteries. The strengthening of the right to repair and removability requirements and provisions on due diligence and supply chains.

A cleaner mobility transition must not come at the expense of decent working conditions elsewhere, however. But Europe can lead the battery revolution, and it has a chance to do so fairly."
Cuffe ,https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-02-14-INT-1-151-0000_EN.html,"Madam President, offshore energy is key to our climate plans. We’re fortunate that wind is a plentiful resource. This report from Morten Petersen is timely. More than 40 years ago, I visited Denmark for the first time and I saw wind turbines around Copenhagen harbour. I saw the future. Sometimes it takes a while for the good things to arrive.

Many countries have harnessed ocean energy, but there is vast untapped potential. Offshore wind is valuable, but we must better integrate this energy with our electricity demand. Making green hydrogen will help, but so too will the European supergrid. The Celtic Interconnector between Ireland and France is moving towards construction. But let’s connect the electricity grids of Ireland with Spain and Portugal to better use this wind resource. That’s a project of common interest that I think everybody would buy into.

But there’s also a nature angle on this. ‘It is a gift to nature’, as my colleague Margrete Auken says, because offshore wind farms can protect areas from bottom trawling. And I think that can be a good thing."
Cuffe ,https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-12-15-INT-3-317-0000_EN.html,"Mr President, transport poverty is a widespread phenomenon in the European Union, and yet it scarcely features in our discussions on transport. There are varying definitions, but being transport poor is generally accepted to be someone who has little or no transport options for their daily needs, or transport spending pushes them below the poverty line or is excessively dangerous or time consuming. You could also add that exposure to things like air and noise pollution is higher amongst the most marginalised in society – think of the housing estates beside motorways versus the leafy suburbs. Many people in the European Union can be described as transport poor.

However, I would warn that some are trying to weaponise this issue to fight against crucial environmental measures, and these issues are not mutually exclusive. More public transport, more cycling, more shared mobility, more rail, means less transport poverty in rural and urban areas, as well as less of an impact on our environment.

I don’t believe that everyone needs an SUV or has a right to fly across Europe for a stag party. These acts are fuelling climate breakdown.

In the last couple of days we’ve heard about the accelerating collapse of the west Antarctic glacier, which could see sea levels rise by 65 centimetres. This is doomsday stuff, so I would ask the Commission not to succumb to those who portray the environmental discussion as meaning less mobility for people. In fact, it means more, safer and greener mobility for all, and we need to marry environmental and social justice."
Cuffe ,https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-11-25-INT-4-142-0000_EN.html,"Mr President, there have been winners and losers in this awful pandemic. And I read this morning that container shipping companies made profits of almost USD 50 billion in the third quarter alone of this year, and that kind of money surpasses the profits of tech giants like Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google, despite the fact that most of the underlying costs for these companies haven’t changed. And these spiralling costs of shipping, up almost a thousand per cent for some routes from China to Europe, these are disrupting supply chains and they are increasing costs for consumers. And the impact of these increases, it tends to impact most on the less well-off and smaller countries. And, of course Covid and the Suez Canal blockage played a role, but we also know that there are competition concerns in the shipping centre. And when can we expect some action from the Commission on concentration in the market?

I do find it interesting that we constantly hear from the shipping industry and from some MEPs that tackling the climate crisis will negatively impact EU shipping’s competitiveness or be too expensive. And this argument is at the core of the opposition to even mild attempts to decarbonise the sector. Of course, such a short-sighted view conveniently ignores the fact that competitiveness is irrelevant if parts of the Earth are uninhabitable.

So my question to the shipping companies is, will you be investing the tens of billions of euro of profit into truly clean technologies to save us from the climate emergency? And another crucial and related issue is that some of our trade flows are inherently unsustainable, sending apples from New Zealand to Ireland is surely unsustainable and we need to tackle all of this.

So the true cost of some things in our economy is rarely reflected, and this is particularly true in the field of transport. If we’re serious about the price of carbon, we must take action. We must tackle the shipping sector and ensure that the decarbonise."
Cuffe ,https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-11-24-INT-3-228-0000_EN.html," Mr President, as you said yourself, Commissioner, the good news is that renewables overtook fossil fuels as the EU’s main electricity source last year. We could only dream of this a decade ago. But the bad news is that we’re subsidising fossil fuels by over EUR 100 per year for every man, woman and child in the European Union. So when we see forest fires and floods and storms on our screens, in a sense we are paying for it with our taxes. And should we really be subsidising this and subsidising air pollution in Kraków, in Cremona, in Slavonski Brod? I don’t think so.

I think if you let the citizens of Europe decide – if you gave each of them a cheque for EUR 100 – they would spend the money on clean air, on fresh water, on solar power. They’d invest in energy storage, demand management with an ambition, a tenacity and a resolve that would put politicians to shame. This is the future that the citizens of Europe deserve."
Cuffe ,https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-10-21-INT-4-053-0000_EN.html," Mr President, despite much fanfare, the Western Balkans Summit earlier this month turned out to be a disappointment. It failed in one of its most crucial tasks, that of offering a tangible and credible path to EU membership for those in the Balkans who continue to dream of a future within the European Union. Despite numerous enacting demands and targets, those countries continue to be offered only false promises.

The EU, of course, is the most successful peace project in history. Yet in a country so recently ravaged by war, we continue to undermine accession to this peace project. And I remember half a century ago the excitement in Ireland when we joined the European Economic Community. It brought economic, social and environmental progress to our island. And the longer we continue to dash Balkan people’s hopes of joining the EU, the more disillusionment will grow with the European project.

So we need to be clear in our demands regarding requirements for accession, but we cannot endlessly break promises. We can no longer play with people’s hopes and dreams because of domestic politics. Of course, internal reforms are needed and institutions need strengthening, but this is a separate and internal matter.

And I strongly regret the continuous undermining of the long stalled start to accession talks for North Macedonia and Albania by Bulgaria on very questionable grounds. And it’s wrong that some member states refuse to even consider setting 2030 as a target date for membership at the summit.

So I call on EU Member States to approve accession talks with these two countries as a matter of urgency and to set clear commitments to other Balkan states. We were given that option half a century ago, the least we can do is offer it to our colleagues in southern and Eastern Europe."
Cuffe ,https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-10-20-INT-3-139-0000_EN.html,"Vice-President Silva Pereira, Commissioner Sinkevičius, there are links between the climate crisis and the issue of refugees coming from amongst the most disadvantaged people in the world. These were the words of David Puttnam in his Shirley Williams memorial lecture last week. Many refugees come from the developing world and the global south. We made a promise to developing countries in Copenhagen in 2009 that we would provide them with USD 100 billion of climate finance. Living up to our promises can help achieve this. It can also strengthen the practices and the efforts of indigenous people to address and respond to climate change. We must also listen to women. Women often have a strong body of knowledge and expertise that can be used in climate change mitigation, disaster reduction and adaptation strategies. Nations with greater female representation in positions of power have smaller carbon footprints."
Cuffe ,https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-10-19-INT-2-312-0000_EN.html,"Mr President, I would like to say to Vice-President Vestager that on her appointment, the Commission President told her to be decisive and ambitious on the big issues that are changing the future of our society, our economy and the planet. Indeed, last month we heard Vice-President Timmermans speak about how environmental action 10 years earlier would have avoided the current energy crisis.

State aid can help us address the rise in gas prices by supporting energy efficiency measures in buildings. You know we need a massive investment in the deep retrofit or renovation of buildings, buildings like this one, which only has an E energy rating – and the ‘E’ doesn’t stand for Europe! State aid can help in the fight against energy poverty but the current guidelines don’t allow this. The category for the improvement of the energy and environmental performance of buildings only allows a 20% contribution from State aid. This needs to increase to at least 40%, and you have the power to make this happen."
Cuffe ,https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-05-18-INT-2-356-0000_EN.html,"Mr President, young people’s lives have been hard hit by COVID. Just as their lives opened up, we said to them ‘Stay at home’. Now, as we open up, we need Erasmus to let young people spread their wings and learn, train and travel abroad, and not just university students but also those in vocational education, training and the sports programmes.

Brexit, like COVID, has also clipped their wings, the wings of young people. I support the Irish Government’s shared island approach to restore access for Northern Irish students to Erasmus+ and hopefully sports and youth exchanges will be included.

I had the privilege of studying abroad in Italy and I know the values of learning and living in another country, experiencing its life, its culture, its sports and its passions. The pandemic showed us that cooperation across borders is essential. Our experiences abroad show us who we are and programmes like Erasmus are key to our shared future."
Cuffe ,https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-03-11-INT-4-093-0000_EN.html,"Madam President, I would say to the Executive Vice—President that local and regional authorities are on the front line when it comes to recovery from COVID. So let’s ensure that these local and regional voices are heard as we rebuild. They have the wisdom and the knowledge to do things right. It has to be a bottom—up as well as a top—down recovery.

In Ireland, the government asked the public for their views, and that is informing the recovery plans. This hasn’t been the case in every country in Europe.

Yet, across Europe, we can see local and regional authorities are ready. They are ready to build A—rated homes. They’re ready to roll out walking and cycling infrastructure and public transport. They’re ready to help communities with the digital transformation.

National governments must listen. Local and regional authorities are ready to fast track a green and digital recovery to the crisis. We must respect their views."
Kelleher,https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-03-09-INT-3-036-0000_EN.html,"Madam President, at the outset the immediate priority must be to support the countries – Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Moldova – in welcoming and supporting and assisting the Ukrainian refugees that are pouring across our borders to the sanctuary of Europe. I visited western Ukraine last weekend to see thousands and thousands of people dragging their bags behind them as they walked for kilometre after kilometre to the sanctuary of Europe.

So when we talk about semesters and we talk about financial frameworks, our immediate priority must be to support the refugees and the countries that are welcoming them at the moment. That must be our immediate priority. We also have to accept that all the fundamentals and the certainties that we based this report on and our views up until now are changed and probably changed forever. So we are now in a new dispensation, and I want to say that from now on, when we talk about stability and growth, when we talk about the general escape clause, we have to accept that Europe’s capacity to provide sanctuary and safety, not only for refugees, but also the new plight that will be facing the citizens of Europe in terms of cost of living, will be issues that we will have to do a big rethink on very, very quickly."
Kelleher,https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-03-09-INT-3-296-0000_EN.html,"Mr President, I welcome the debate on this particular issue regarding the report on fair and simple taxation supporting recovery. And I suppose while we were publishing these reports and processing these reports the last number of weeks, we are now very much in a new dispensation, Commissioner. We face existential challenges in terms of the Ukrainian crisis, and it has changed all the basic metrics on which we were assessing growth into the future and making projections and predictions about how Europe would recover from the COVID pandemic. But we now, as I said, face a more serious crisis, the immediacy obviously of supporting Ukraine, addressing the refugee crisis and supporting the countries where refugees are spilling into the European Union so they can cope and provide humanitarian assistance.

But beyond that, when we talk about a fair and simple taxation supporting the recovery, we also have to acknowledge that we do need to do an awful lot more in terms of coordinating within the European Union, reducing the administrative burden so small and medium-sized businesses can trade across the entirety of the single market. And that is always, and consistently is, a significant challenge.

So we want to simplify the codes, but at the same time, I am challenged because I also have a difficulty with some of the tone and the content, not just necessarily of this report, but of the general content coming from the Commission, for example, around the issue of unanimity in taxation matters. And Commissioner Gentiloni, you have often raised this particular issue yourself. And I just highlight one instance that will create huge difficulties for Irish people in the short and medium term, that is the cost of home heating oil, a massive increase in home heating oil, and the Irish Government’s hands are tied because there is no flexibility around the issue of VAT in terms of home heating oil. So I bring that to your attention because I am concerned with this continual drift and encroachment of the independence of countries to set their own tax rates. In income tax specifically and other areas, I have a deep concern.

But I make a plea on the issue of VAT that there would be flexibility, not just to Ireland, but to many Member States that will find that families will be significantly challenged because of the cost increases in home heating oil and many other fuel products. "
Kelleher,https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-03-09-INT-3-310-0000_EN.html,"Mr President, first of all, I’d like to thank the rapporteur Pedro Marques and my fellow shadows for the excellent work on this particular report. Of course, the withholding tax framework was unfortunately thrust into the spotlight by a series of scandals involving flawed and complex webs of transactions in the so-called cum-ex and cum-cum scandals. It is clear that the framework needs reform. We need to close the loopholes and improve communication amongst our tax authorities, as was referenced by Pedro Marques and also by the Commissioner himself this evening.

And we need to ensure that criminals can be identified and brought to justice, and that is where we have a significant challenge within many Member States. The political will, the legislation, the enforcement, the effort of the system to ensure that those that are caught in tax evasion are prosecuted. We do have, by and large, two rules. One’s for smaller criminals and those that fly private jets and are very often swanning around in the finest resorts in their yachts. Yet no sanctions taken against people who wilfully abuse our tax laws.

Another more positive aim of the reform is to simplify and streamline the reclaiming of withholding tax. And this was obviously an issue that was brought to our attention when we spoke to many of the experts in this particular area. Many of them stressed that it was burdensome, the administrative procedures across Member States were very difficult and hard to understand, and that they didn’t link into each other from a digital point of view. So we do need to digitise and when we talk again about digital Europe in the area of tax authorities talking to each other, being able to relay live information, transactions across Member States, the administration of taxation itself, we do have to embrace that concept of digitisation.

And while I’m often critical of the Commission and people in this House with regard to Article 116 about rates of taxation and about the sovereignty of countries in terms of striking rates in taxation, we still have the opportunity – and in my view the obligation – to ensure that we share information, that we pool information, so that there is no hiding place for those that want to abuse our complex tax laws that are in various Member States.

So we do need to simplify the overall taxation code, and I welcome this particular report. I think it is a very inclusive report. It takes into account a lot of the views expressed by the various groups. But more importantly, the overall framework of taxation referred to in Pillar I and Pillar II needs also to be transposed to ensure that we have an effective modern taxation system for the EU in the years ahead."
Kelleher,https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-02-15-INT-2-055-0000_EN.html,"Madam President, strengthening Europe in the fight against cancer and the Commission’s Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan are both very welcome initiatives, and of course, we should learn something from the pandemic, Commissioner: your role and that of the Commission and Europe in general, pooling its resources, coming together to face a significant challenge.

There’s nothing as significant as the challenges that we face in the area of cancer. We need to be able to prevent, we need to have the research, the innovation and the creativity behind that to assess the statistics. We need early detection, and we need diagnostics and treatment. The idea that a young child will not be diagnosed because of where they’re born or who they’re born to is something that is a failure, not only of Member States and their policies, but equally of the European Union itself.

So I would urge that we would cooperate in the areas of prevention, in research and development and also in rare diseases, Commissioner. I believe that, in the area of rare cancers, Europe has a central role in bringing all Member States’ health capacities together to ensure diagnosis and treatments for those with rare diseases. I commend the broad thrust of the report and the broader efforts of the Commission in terms of Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan, but we must do a lot and it’s better to do it together."
Kelleher,https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-02-14-INT-1-058-0000_EN.html,"Madam President, inflation is a continuing challenge now at the moment. The Commission published its Winter 2022 Economic Forecast last week, and it said that inflation will be around 3% for most of this year. Of course, there are now the challenges with geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and Russia.

Now all eyes are on the ECB, but Madame Lagarde, I just want to bring your attention to the fact that in the event of there being a necessity to raise interest rates to address the issue of inflation, I want you to take into account the fact that we do not have uniform interest rates across the European Union.

And I do believe that the ECB and the European Banking Authority have an obligation to unleash the blockages that are causing significant difficulties for some countries in keeping interest rates low – and I significantly mention Ireland itself, where the capital requirements and prudential obligations on our banks are looking at it through the prism of the last financial crisis. We have reduced our non-performing loans, our banks are in a healthy state, yet our obligations are based on historical facts. I would believe and urge that you should act on this in the event of interest rates having to rise, because this would have a profound impact on Ireland and on other countries that have higher interest rates than the EU average."
Kelleher,https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2022-01-20-INT-4-072-0000_EN.html,"Madam President, first and foremost, may I say at the outset I did very much welcome this process with regard to the Committee of Inquiry on the Protection of Animals during Transport (ANIT) and the engagement that we had with outside bodies, NGOs, science, research and just a broader consultation within this Parliament itself. And throughout that debate I had a fundamental disagreement with many people on the committee, but at the same time, we all are collectively in here trying to address the same issue. And that’s to ensure that animal welfare is brought to the highest priority in the European Union and also within Member States.

Let us be under no illusions. There have been catastrophic failures by the European Union and Member States in the enforcement of Regulation (EC) No 1/2005. We saw that recently with the ships the Elbeik and the Karim Allah, for example, in the Mediterranean. So, from that perspective, we do need to ensure that regardless of where these consultations and this report take us, in the meantime we have to ensure that Regulation (EC) No 1/2005 is enforced, is vindicated and that the integrity of animal transport and the welfare of animals in transport is vindicated too, Commissioner. So from that perspective, while we continue our consultations, while you consider your deliberations with regard to new regulations, we have to ensure that animal welfare is kept to the highest priority on everybody’s agenda.

So from my perspective, and I say this honestly in this European Parliament, this Parliament should represent everybody. We shouldn’t be exclusively in favour of animal rights and against farmers, or for farmers and against animal rights. We fundamentally have the capacity in this particular Chamber, and the Commission and the Council, to ensure that they can both work in tandem. I am very much in favour of ensuring the highest welfare standards of animals from birth right through to the fork. But at the same time, we can’t make theme parks or adventure parks out of our rural communities. So I honestly believe that if we work collectively, intelligently, base our decisions on science, base our decisions on research and base our decisions on the fact that people in rural communities across the entirety of the European Union provide us every day with food, sustenance, maintaining the population. They rear their families. They live in rural communities, sustain those rural communities.

So from that perspective, I urge everybody in this Parliament, wherever the report takes us, wherever deliberations with the Commission and the regulations that will come forward in 2023, ensure in the meantime that we enforce the standards that are there. And when we bring forward new regulations, we bring forward regulations that are based on the realities of what happened both in terms of animal welfare and what happens with regard to farmers and broader rural communities across the entirety of the European Union.

It can’t be a one-size-fits-all. It can’t be animal transport and animal rights against farmers and rural communities, or vice versa. We have the intelligence and the capacity, and the Commission is obligated to bring forward regulations that are real, that are sincere, that take into account animal welfare in transport, and also sustaining agriculture, rural communities and farming communities."
Kelleher,https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-12-16-INT-4-112-0000_EN.html,"Mr President, I utterly condemn the attacks on freedom of expression, arbitrary imprisonment, detaining political opponents, forced labour camps, censorship and political re-education of minorities by the Cuban regime. Be it a totalitarian regime on the left or on the right, we must condemn in equal measure both, because both are fundamentally anathema to what this House stands for.

I am surprised to listen to some people because of their ideological views on the left that will stand here, in this Parliament that affords us huge luxuries and opportunities in terms of freedom, and defend the Cuban regime, which has persecuted its people for years. It is not so long ago when Cuban people weren’t even allowed to leave their country, and they wanted to leave it by the hundreds of thousands.

So let us be very clear. Condemn totalitarian regimes that are corrupt on the right and are corrupt on the left. I stand for the centre. I stand for liberty and freedom and I stand with the Cuban people. Shame on those who support the Cuban regime as it is. "
Kelleher,https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-12-13-INT-1-166-0000_EN.html,"Madam President, I speak on two types of inflation. Firstly, the construction materials inflation, which obviously is going to put huge pressure on governments and on the European Union, too, in terms of value for money for the Next Generation recovery fund. And the difficulties that governments will have in providing public housing for citizens and for those that want to afford or can afford to buy a house; it is now slipping away from them. Ordinary citizens unable to get on the ladder in terms of the cost of housing because of the inflation in construction materials. On top of that, the whole issue of consumer price index inflation as well, which is really hitting lower-income families. It is the enemy of the lower-income people, inflation in this context.

We have to do something to address these two particular issues: construction material inflation and consumer price inflation as well. The common reason for the rise, of course, in inflation is COVID-19 and the impact it has had on supply chains and logistical supply chains. But equally, the issue of fuel, energy, gas and oil. These particular issues are areas that the Commission and national governments will have to get on top of. Otherwise, we will condemn many people being unable to purchase a home and many people unable to heat their homes because of the inflationary pressures."
Kelleher,https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-11-24-INT-3-307-0000_EN.html,"Madam President, we need to have a uniform new-born screening programme. We need to ensure there’s early diagnosis. We have too many mis-diagnoses, non-diagnosis, delayed diagnosis of children when they are born in the area of rare diseases. And we also have to accept that we have to have collaboration between Member States in terms of research, innovation, specialist services, medical personnel in the areas of the very rare diseases, because we simply cannot assume that every country will have the capacity, or the population base, or the expertise, or the wherewithal, or the resources, to make available the therapeutic medicines, the orphan medicines and the care that is required in every area of rare diseases.

So, this European Action Plan Against Rare Diseases is very welcome, and we have to ensure now that it is bought into by the Member States in areas of, as I said, support for people with rare diseases.

My specific area of interest is in the context of PKU (Phenylketonuria) – I am the co-chair of a cross party alliance here in the European Parliament, and we do want to bring the issue of rare diseases right to the very top and to ensure that when medicines are approved by the European Medicines Agency that every citizen in the European Union can get access to them, not based on individual Member States and their ability to pay or not. So I commend the review and I hope that we will engage positively with all Member States."
Kelleher,https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/CRE-9-2021-11-10-INT-1-193-0000_EN.html,"Mr President, I welcome the opportunity to speak on this report.

I think it’s important that we do have a collective embracement of education across the continent. We have to accept that we need to ensure we have recognition of skills – both in terms of learning but also in terms of teaching. For too long we’ve had a disparate approach to education.

I also accept that the education process is part of Member State competency. But above and beyond that, if you look at what the Erasmus Programme has achieved in recent times in terms of third—level students being able to travel abroad, to learn abroad, to live abroad, and to love abroad, we certainly need to get that concept across the entire plethora of the educational strata.

So I would certainly urge that the report, when being adopted and the EU Commission coming forward, would look at the Bologna Process and accept that we do need to ensure that skills and competencies are approached across the entire European Union.

Equally and finally, with regard to language, it is a failure of the European Union that we haven’t gotten a process of proper language training capabilities across the entire continent.

So language skills, teacher skills and education skills and competencies across the entire eurozone, and recognition of the same, is an important factor to ensure the Bologna Process can move ahead. "
